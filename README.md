### Mastering AI Interaction: Unveiling the Power of Prompt Engineering

- AI is at the heart of Baddil! We leveraged the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) API and prompt engineering to deliver powerful features: recommending the most relevant category to search in, evaluating user credibility, and suggesting the optimal item from the user's wallet to barter with.
